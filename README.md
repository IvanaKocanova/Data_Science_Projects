* [A Visual Analytics Workflow for Investigating Customers’ Transactions in
Convenience Stores](https://github.com/IvanaKocanova/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Vizual_workflow_analysis_.pdf) :
This research was undertaken in partnership with one of the top UK retailers. The objective was to investigating how novel pattern mining and visualization techniques can speed-up the analysis of shopping behaviour.

* [Detection of functional commuting zones with complex networks](https://github.com/IvanaKocanova/Community_detection_with_Complex_Networks) :
To better understand ever-evolving urban life, this research constructs functional zones from networks which use complex travel-flow data. Using complex networks, we uncover inherent community structure within the UK city of Leeds. 

* [Twitter analysis of climate change perceptions](https://github.com/IvanaKocanova/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Climate_change_perceptions.ipynb) : As nations face unavoidable challenge of adapting to a changing climate, the awareness about humans’ effect on environment has reached all-time high. Through Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis on tweets, I wanted to investigate concerns and perceptions regarding our environment.

* [Prediction of house prices using Multiple Linear Regression](https://github.com/IvanaKocanova/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/House_price_prediction_Linear_regression.ipynb)  (work in progress) : I have decided to become a real estate agent for a day! In order to compete with other agents, I have used the power of Multiple Linear Regression.
