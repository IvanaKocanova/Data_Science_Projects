* [Has the pandemic ended the allure of big cities?](https://www.frontier-economics.com/uk/en/news-and-articles/articles/article-i8141-has-the-pandemic-ended-the-allure-of-big-cities/#) :
Data science article I wrote while working in Frontier Economics. After the turbulent 2020, I was interested whether the city living has lost some of its appeal. Check out my article to find out more!

* [Detection of functional commuting zones with complex networks](https://github.com/IvanaKocanova/Community_detection_with_Complex_Networks) :
To better understand ever-evolving urban life, this research constructs functional zones from networks which use complex travel-flow data. Using complex networks, we uncover inherent community structure within the UK city of Leeds. 

* [Twitter analysis of climate change perceptions](https://github.com/IvanaKocanova/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/script/python/Climate_change_perceptions.ipynb) : As nations face unavoidable challenge of adapting to a changing climate, the awareness about humans’ effect on environment has reached all-time high. Through Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis on tweets, I wanted to investigate concerns and perceptions regarding our environment.

* [Covid in 10 charts](https://www.frontier-economics.com/uk/en/news-and-articles/articles/article-i8317-covid-in-10-charts/) :
Second data science article I wrote while working in Frontier Economics. In this article we have looked at the impact of Covid across multiple sectors utilizing large variety of data sources from Google mobility reports to furlough uptake data.

* [Predicting Boston house prices](https://github.com/IvanaKocanova/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/script/python/House_price_prediction_Linear_regression.ipynb) : I have decided to become a real estate agent for a day! In order to compete with other agents, I have used the power of Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest. 

* [A Visual Analytics Workflow for Investigating Customers’ Transactions in
Convenience Stores](https://github.com/IvanaKocanova/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/pdf/Vizual_workflow_analysis_.pdf) :
This research was undertaken in partnership with one of the top UK retailers. The objective was to investigating how novel pattern mining and visualization techniques can speed-up the analysis of shopping behaviour.
