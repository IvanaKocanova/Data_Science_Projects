* [A Visual Analytics Workflow for Investigating Customers’ Transactions in
Convenience Stores](https://github.com/IvanaKocanova/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Vizual_workflow_analysis_.pdf) :
This research was undertaken in partnership with one of the top UK retailers. The objective was to investigating how novel pattern mining and visualization techniques can speed-up the analysis of shopping behaviour.

* [Detection of functional commuting zones with complex networks](https://github.com/IvanaKocanova/Community_detection_with_Complex_Networks) :
To better understand ever-evolving urban life, this research constructs functional zones from networks which use complex travel-flow data. Using complex networks, we uncover inherent community structure within the UK city of Leeds. 

* [How climate change perceptions vary around the world?](https://github.com/IvanaKocanova/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Climate_change_perceptions.ipynb) (work in progress) : As nations face unavoidable challenge of adapting to a changing climate, the awareness about humans’ effect on environment has reached all-time high. Through Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis on tweets, I wanted to investigate country specific concerns and perceptions regarding our environment.
